# Example Notebooks

Here are some example notebooks describing and demonstrating the processes of:
- placing a spectral library in the data directory, and processing this into a material collection object
- placing instrument information in the data directory, and again, processing this into a material object
- sampling a material collection with an instrument, and printing key results, including plots and RMSE metrics
- computing the spectral parameters afforded by an instrument
- performing LDA and ranking the spectral parameter combinations afforded by the instrument on the dataset.
